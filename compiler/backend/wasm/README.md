This theories in this directory are based on
 
  WebAssembly Core Specification
  W3C First Public Working Draft, 15 February 2018
 
which is available at
 
 https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-wasm-core-1-20180215/
 
At the time of writing (August 2018), the version

The ordering of definitions is meant to mirror the
original document. However, some exceptions were
made to have all definitions "straight forward".
These exceptions are marked with comments.

The three theories roughly correspond to chapters
of the spec:

| Theory      |                                  Chapter |
|-------------+------------------------------------------|
| wasmLang    | 2 (with definitions from later chapters) |
| wasmStatic  | 3                                        |
| wasmDynamic | 4                                        |
